This is just a set of example scripts that explore the various Mojolicious utilities - things
that make 'life' a little easier.

Here is a quote from the book 'Mojo Web Clients' by Brian Foy :-

    Mojo comes with its own implementations of many common tools, and often
    these reinventions work better or are more pleasing than the tools they replaced. This also allows Mojo to 
    severely limit its dependencies; that makes development, maintenance, and installation much easier
